DESCRIPTION FOR THE TASK :

The Smart Data Analyzer is a Python-based data analysis tool designed to automate the process of exploring and understanding structured datasets, such as CSV files. This project aims to assist data analysts, students, and beginners in quickly analyzing raw data, identifying patterns, and generating visual insights without the need for advanced programming knowledge.

The tool starts by loading a user-specified CSV file and provides a detailed summary of the dataset, including data types, missing values, and basic statistical descriptions. It then performs data cleaning by removing rows with excessive null values and filling remaining missing data using the mean of each column.

After cleaning, the analyzer automatically generates a correlation heatmap to help users understand relationships between numerical variables. If the dataset contains categorical columns (like gender or product type), it creates bar charts to show value distributions, making it easier to identify dominant categories.

An optional feature allows users to build a basic machine learning model using Linear Regression. The user can specify a target column to predict, and the system trains the model and displays the mean squared error, providing insight into prediction accuracy.

This project uses powerful libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, making it a great hands-on example of data handling, visualization, and modeling in Python. It is fully executable in Python IDLE or Google Colab, making it highly accessible and user-friendly.
